<h1>ForagerIO</h1>
ForagerIO is a Swift-based application that allows users to recognize plants in a picture by submitting the image via a POST HTTP request to the PlantNet website. This app leverages the free API provided by PlantNet, available to registered users.

<h2>Features</h2>
Submit images to the PlantNet API to identify plants
Display plant recognition results including names and descriptions
Simple and intuitive UI design focused on ease of use
<i>Implementation of asynchronous network calls and concurrency</i>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
This project was developed as a means to apply and expand my knowledge of concurrency and API calls in Swift. I took on the challenge of coding and solving issues independently, allowing me to dive deeper into Swift’s capabilities while exploring two of my passions: network HTTP calls and plant studying.

<h2>Usage</h2>
To use the app, download the repository and insert your API Key on the ContentView file, line 34. After that, run on the simulator or on your iPhone and select a photo of a plant, and the app will send the image to the PlantNet API for identification. The results will provide you with the plant’s name and additional details.

<h2>Purpose</h2>
This project was developed with no monetary intent and serves as a practice tool to display and enhance my skills in Swift, particularly in the areas of concurrency, UI design, and network calls.

<h2>License</h2>
This project is open-sourced under the MIT license. Feel free to use it for learning and development purposes.
